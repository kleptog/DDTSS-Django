DDTSS-Django
============

This is the experimental Django reimplementation of the DDTSS. The old
system used a simple key-value store without transactions and couldn't
access the DDTP database directly. This version is implemented in Django
with SQLalchemy for the ORM.

First is a basic setup guide, below is some more details for developers.

Setup
=====

To setup this version to run locally you need to do a few steps.

1. Configure the buildout.

$ python bootstrap.py
$ bin/buildout

This will download an install any packages needed to run the DDTSS. You will
need to install a postgresql server manually.

2. Create a PostgreSQL database called 'ddtp' with the correct encoding.

$ createdb ddtp -E UTF8

You probably need to the database superuser to do this.

Make sure you can connect to it without a password, preferably with 'ident
sameuser' authentication.  The user name is not relevant, you should be able
to login with your normal user name (otherwise see createuser).  Ensure that
when you type:

$ psql ddtp

It logs you into the database without asking for a password.

3. Setup the schema for DDTP.

$ psql ddtp -q -f src/ddtp/database/initial/install-ddtp.sql

This should complete without any errors.

If you want to test the DDTSS, you need more. Note that the schema for the
DDTSS is not yet finalised and subject to change, so you may have to redo
this step occasionally.

$ psql ddtp -q -f src/ddtp/database/initial/install-ddtss.sql

4. Add some sample data. Without some data in the database you can't do very
much.

Download the sample data. This is just a tiny fraction (approximately one
10,000th) of the full DDTP database, but enough to get you started with
testing everything.  It can be loaded in seconds rather than hours.

$ wget http://kleptog.org/temp/ddtp-sample.tar.gz

Unpack the tarball into a temporary directory. Then while in that directory
execute:

$ psql ddtp -q -f src/ddtp/database/initial/load_sample.sql

This should also complete without errors or warnings.

For sample data for the DDTSS, you need to do:

$ psql ddtp -q -f src/ddtp/database/initial/load_sample_ddtss.sql

5. Start up the Django test server.

Setting up a full production Django server is outside the scope of this
README. This runs the development server:

$ bin/django generate_secret_key
$ bin/django syncdb
$ bin/django runserver

There is now a test server running on http://localhost:8000/

Development Tips
================

This is a Buildout with a Django project. All sources are in the src/
directory.  The project is in src/ddtp/.  Within that we have the following
directories:

src/ddtp           - Project root
    development.py - Development Django settings
    production.py  - Production Django settings
    urls.py        - Main URL configuration

src/ddtp/database  - Database setup and configuration
    db.py          - database session setup
    ddtp.py        - ORM for DDTP tables
    ddtss.py       - ORM for DDTSS tables

src/ddtp/ddt       - DDTP website application
    views.py       - Views for DDTP application

src/ddtp/templates - Templates for DDTP website
    ddtss/         - Templates for DDTSS website

src/ddtp/media     - Images used by templates

For development it is useful to know the command:

$ bin/django shell

Which gives you an IPython shell with all the paths set correctly.
